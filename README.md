## Grove

### Description

Grove is a small digital playground, a creative and relaxing experiment where you explore procedural landscapes and turn them into your own colorful scenery.

This app was built using [Cinder](https:://libcinder.org) an awesome and modern c++ library for creative coding created by Andrew Bell and Hai Nguyen. Many thanks to Hai for his amazing work at porting Cinder to Android and his countless hours of help to solve all the platform related issues. Many thanks as well to [David Thomas and Julien Diels](http://www.brains-agency.be) for re-drawing all the icons used in the app.
